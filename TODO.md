## Written in Rust ofcourse
- [ ] maybe interactive mode with a tui/gui app:
    - potentially [written in rust](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) (bc idk how to do that in C++ lol)
    - else c++ + ncurses.h
    - separate thread, main emulator can call functions to push render updates
    - always display regs
    - set regs
    - disassembly of current execution region (PC Â± 0x8)
    - display buffer
    - memory dump
    - assembly command prompt
